# Spotify Clone 🎧🎵

**Spotify Clone** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## About this project 🚀

I created this project by following a tutorial while learning and practicing JavaScript concepts. The goal was to understand how a real-world music streaming interface works and to apply JavaScript logic in a structured way.

The app replicates core features of a music streaming platform, allowing users to browse songs, play and pause tracks, and control audio playback. JavaScript is used to handle audio controls, track selection, and dynamic UI updates, while HTML and CSS are used to build a clean, modern layout inspired by Spotify’s design.

Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, explore browser audio functionality, and gain confidence in building more complex, interactive user interfaces.
